# JSRHDNewSetup
A more modern setup program for Jet Set Radio HD.

## Why?
Jet Set Radio HD's original setup utility has quite a few problems. The biggest one being that a lot of people straight up cannot open it (most likely) due to a required DirectX dependency not being installed by the Steam install script.\
\
Other issues include the general unintuitiveness of the program and the extremely outdated dependencies it relies on.

## Installation
- Download the .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime ([x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.8-windows-x64-installer) | [x86](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.8-windows-x86-installer)) if you don't have it installed already.
- Download the jsrsetup.exe file from the Releases tab.
- Place it in your Jet Set Radio HD game directory (can be accessed by right clicking the game on Steam and selecting Manage -> Browse Local Files)
- Accept any prompts to replace executables.

  **Note about Linux users:** You may have to install the .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime via Protontricks.


## TODO
- Add support for keybind remapping
